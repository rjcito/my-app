# Roberto's Cleaning Schedule 
My application loads a cleaning schedule for the week. Every time anyone wants to see 
my cleaning business' schedule, all they have to do is go to my application URL.

#Adding an item to my schedule
If I want to add a new house for cleaning, I can go to the nav bar and click the "AddHouse" button. 
Clicking the AddHouse button will redirect me to a new screen which will load up a form where I can input required data to submit this item to the schedule.
If I go back to my home page, I should be able to see the new item loaded onto the screen.
